# 🐍 Python OOP: Encapsulation with Private Members

## 🎯 AIM

To implement **Encapsulation** in Python by defining a class `Rectangle` with **private member variables** `__length` and `__breadth`.
---

## 🧠 ALGORITHM

1. **Define the Class**:
   - Create a class `Rectangle` with two private attributes: `__length` and `__breadth`.

2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use the `__init__()` constructor to set initial values for `__length` and `__breadth`.

3. **Print Values**:
   - Display the private variables from within the class to demonstrate access.

4. **Instantiate the Object**:
   - Create an object of the `Rectangle` class to trigger the constructor.

---

## 💻 Program
```
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self,length,breadth):
        self.__length = length #private variable
        self.__breadth = breadth#private variable
    def display(self):
        print(self.__length)
        print(self.__breadth)
 
rect = Rectangle(5,3)
rect.display()


```
## Output
<img width="920" height="216" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7abee980-32f2-4dae-b5a0-c4dcb82fced3" />


## Result
Thus the program to implement Encapsulation in Python by defining a class Rectangle with private member variables __length and __breadth is executed successfully
